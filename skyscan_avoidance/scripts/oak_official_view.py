"""Luxonis' own viewer, straight off the device. No ROS, none of our code.

This exists to answer one question and only one: is the CAMERA healthy, or is
our stack the problem? It talks to the OAK with the stock DepthAI v3 API and
serves Luxonis' built-in visualiser, so nothing in skyscan_avoidance — not the
driver params, not sector_builder, not depth_view — is in the path.

    python3 scripts/oak_official_view.py

Then open http://localhost:8082 in a browser.

Read it like this:
  * choppy/laggy/dropping out HERE too  -> the camera or the USB link. Our code
    is not involved and cannot be the cause.
  * smooth here, bad in depth_view      -> our stack. Come back and debug it.

Stereo depth is inherently noisy on textureless surfaces (blank walls, plain
floors); pixels dropping in and out there is normal and is exactly why
sector_builder has min_valid_px_fraction_per_bin. Sustained multi-second
freezes or the stream dying are NOT normal — that is the USB fault.
